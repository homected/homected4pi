Homected4pi
===========

With version 1.0 of homected4pi I tried to create a set of xAP applications to create a home automation system, but the xAP protocol is in a static situation and I decide to give the jump to a new and better system called TheThingSystem (http://thethingsystem.com).
 
Homected4pi version 2.0 is a new develop to create a new home automation system based on TheThingSystem .

At this point I'll try to convert my existing xAP applications (CurrentCost, RFXCOM, etc) to interactuate with TheThingSystem running on a RaspberryPi and create new ones.
